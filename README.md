# Jesse Miller Resume

My resume written in LaTeX. Note that different variations of the resume may be maintained on separate git branches, and are controlled by conditional toggles within the tex file.

Additionally, to trim my resume's length I may comment out certain sections so that they are not rendered but the information remains within the .tex file.
